# Chapter 10: Production Trading Systems — The 45-Minute $460M Lesson

> "Everyone has a testing environment. Some people are lucky enough to have a totally separate environment to run production in." — Anonymous DevOps Engineer

**August 1, 2012. 9:30:00 AM EST. New York Stock Exchange.**

Knight Capital Group, the largest trader in US equities, handling 17% of all NYSE volume, deployed new trading software to production. The deployment seemed successful. The system reported green across all eight servers.

But Server #8 had a silent failure. The deployment script couldn't establish an SSH connection, so it skipped that server and continued. The script's fatal design flaw: **it reported success anyway**.

**9:30:01 AM:** Markets open. Seven servers run the new SMARS (Smart Market Access Routing System) code. Server #8 runs the old code, which includes a dormant algorithm called "Power Peg" — obsolete since 2003, nine years earlier, but still lurking in the codebase.

The new code repurposed an old feature flag. On Server #8, that flag activated Power Peg instead of the new routing logic.

**9:30:10 AM:** Trading desk notices unusual activity. Knight is buying massive quantities of stock at market prices, then immediately selling at market prices, losing the bid-ask spread on every trade. The system is executing 100 trades per second.

**9:32:00 AM:** First internal alerts fire. Engineers scramble to understand what's happening.

**9:45:00 AM:** Engineers identify the problem: Server #8 is running old code. They begin the kill switch procedure.

**9:47:00 AM:** In attempting to stop Server #8, engineers **accidentally turn OFF the seven working servers and leave Server #8 running**. The problem accelerates.

**10:00:00 AM:** Engineers realize their mistake, finally shut down Server #8.

**10:15:00 AM:** Trading stops. Damage assessment begins.

---

**The Damage:**

- **45 minutes:** Duration of runaway algorithm
- **4,096,968 trades:** Executed across 154 stocks
- **397 million shares:** Total volume (more than entire firms trade in a day)
- **$3.5 billion long:** Unintended buy positions
- **$3.15 billion short:** Unintended sell positions
- **$6.65 billion gross exposure:** With only $365M in capital
- **$460 million realized loss:** After unwinding positions
- **17 days later:** Knight Capital sold to Getco for $1.4B (90% discount)

---

**The Root Causes (ALL Preventable):**

1. **Manual deployment:** Engineers manually deployed to each server (no automation)
2. **Silent script failure:** Deployment script failed silently on Server #8
3. **No deployment verification:** No post-deployment smoke tests
4. **Dead code in production:** Power Peg obsolete for 9 years, never removed
5. **Repurposed feature flag:** Old flag reused for new functionality (confusion)
6. **No automated kill switch:** Took 17 minutes to stop trading manually
7. **Inadequate monitoring:** No alert for unusual trading volume
8. **No transaction limits:** System had no hard cap on order count or exposure
9. **Poor incident response:** Engineers made it worse by shutting down wrong servers
10. **No rollback procedure:** Couldn't quickly revert to previous version

**Cost per minute:** $10.2 million
**Cost per preventable failure:** $46 million

This chapter teaches you how to build production systems that would have prevented every single one of these failures.

## 10.1 Why Production is Different — The Five Reality Gaps

Backtesting is a controlled laboratory experiment. Production is a live battlefield with fog of war, unexpected enemies, and no rewind button.

### 10.1.1 The Reality Gap Matrix

| Aspect | Backtest Assumption | Production Reality | Impact |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|--------|
| **Data** | Clean, complete, arrives on time | Late, missing, revised, out-of-order, vendor failures | Stale signals, wrong decisions |
| **Execution** | Instant fills at expected prices | Partial fills, rejections, queue position 187 | Unintended exposure, basis risk |
| **Latency** | Zero: signal → order → fill | Network (1-50ms), GC pauses (10-500ms), CPU contention | Missed opportunities, adverse selection |
| **State** | Perfect memory, no crashes | Crashes every 48 hours (median), restarts lose state | Position drift, duplicate orders |
| **Concurrency** | Single-threaded, deterministic | Race conditions, deadlocks, thread safety bugs | Data corruption, incorrect P&L |
| **Dependencies** | Always available | Market data feed down 0.1% of time, exchange outage 0.01% | Trading blackout, forced liquidation |

### 10.1.2 The Five Production Challenges

**Challenge 1: Data Pipeline Failures**

Your strategy needs SPY prices to calculate signals. What happens when:
- **Market data feed is 5 seconds late?** (High volatility caused congestion)
- **Quotes show crossed market?** (Bid $400.05, Ask $400.00 — impossible, but happens)
- **Stock split not reflected?** (Database says AAPL = $800, reality = $200 post-split)
- **Network partition?** (Can't reach exchange, but already have open orders)

**Real example (August 2020):**
- Multiple market data vendors (including Bloomberg, Refinitiv) had 15-minute outage
- Strategies relying on single feed were blind
- Strategies with redundant feeds switched over automatically
- Cost difference: $0 vs millions in missed opportunities

**Challenge 2: Execution Complexity**

Backtest: "Buy 10,000 shares at $50.00"
Production: "Which venue? What order type? What time-in-force?"

**Execution decisions:**
1. **Venue selection:** NYSE, NASDAQ, IEX, BATS, 12+ other exchanges
2. **Order type:** Market (fast, expensive), Limit (cheap, uncertain), Stop (conditional)
3. **Time-in-force:** IOC (immediate or cancel), GTC (good til cancel), FOK (fill or kill)
4. **Smart order routing:** Split order across venues to minimize market impact

**Reality:** Your 10,000 share order becomes:
- 3,200 shares @ $50.02 on NYSE (filled)
- 4,800 shares @ $50.05 on NASDAQ (filled)
- 1,500 shares @ $50.09 on BATS (filled)
- 500 shares @ $50.15 limit on IEX (rejected, too far from mid)

Average fill: $50.048 (not $50.00)
Slippage: 9.6 bps (almost 10 bps, not 2 bps assumed in backtest)

**Challenge 3: State Management**

Your strategy crashes at 11:37 AM. When it restarts at 11:39 AM:
- What positions do you have?
- Which orders are still open?
- What was the last price you processed?
- What fills happened during the 2-minute blackout?

**Backtest:** Perfect memory, instant recovery
**Production:** 2-minute reconciliation process:

1. Query exchange: "What orders do I have open?" (500ms API call)
2. Query exchange: "What fills since 11:37 AM?" (may be delayed, may be incomplete)
3. Query internal database: "What was my position at 11:37 AM?" (may be stale)
4. Reconcile: Database position + fills = current position (hopefully)
5. Resume trading at 11:39 AM (missed 50+ trading opportunities)

**Challenge 4: Performance Under Load**

Your backtest processes 1,000 bars per day comfortably.

Production reality:
- **Market open (9:30:00-9:30:05 AM):** 50,000 quotes per second (100x normal)
- **News release:** Apple earnings 5 minutes early, 200,000 quotes/sec spike
- **Your system:** CPU at 100%, memory at 95%, GC pause for 800ms
- **Result:** Missed first 800ms of price movement (10 seconds in crypto time)

**Challenge 5: Operational Resilience**

Murphy's Law is not a joke in production. Everything that can go wrong, will:

- **Software bugs:** Race condition only triggers under high load (found in production)
- **Infrastructure failures:** AWS us-east-1 outage (happens every 18 months)
- **Market regime changes:** March 2020 COVID crash (VIX 20 → 80 in 3 days)
- **Black swan events:** Trading halted exchange-wide (9/11, circuit breakers)
- **Human error:** Engineer runs DELETE instead of SELECT (wrong terminal)

**Backtest assumption:** None of this happens
**Production reality:** Plan for all of this

## 10.2 System Architecture — Event-Driven Trading Systems

### 10.2.1 Why Event-Driven Architecture?

Traditional architectures have a main loop:

```python
# TRADITIONAL (BAD FOR TRADING)
while True:
    prices = fetch_latest_prices()      # Blocking call
    signals = calculate_signals(prices)
    if signals:
        execute_orders(signals)         # Blocking call
    sleep(1)  # Wait 1 second
```

**Problems:**
1. **Blocking:** If `fetch_latest_prices()` takes 2 seconds, you miss 1 second of price movement
2. **Synchronous:** Can't process multiple symbols in parallel
3. **Tight coupling:** Strategy logic mixed with data fetching and order execution
4. **No backpressure:** If signals generate faster than you can execute, queue grows unbounded

**Event-driven solution:**

```lisp
;; EVENT-DRIVEN (GOOD FOR TRADING)
;; Components communicate via messages (events)
;; Each component runs independently
;; No blocking, no tight coupling

;; Market Data Handler publishes price events
(on-price-update "AAPL" 150.25
  (publish :topic "market-data"
           :event {:symbol "AAPL" :price 150.25 :timestamp (now)}))

;; Strategy subscribes to price events, publishes order requests
(subscribe :topic "market-data"
  (lambda (event)
    (let ((signals (calculate-signals event)))
      (if (not (null? signals))
          (publish :topic "order-requests" :event signals)))))

;; Order Manager subscribes to order requests, publishes executions
(subscribe :topic "order-requests"
  (lambda (order-request)
    (execute-order order-request)))
```

**Benefits:**
1. **Non-blocking:** Each component processes events independently
2. **Parallel:** Multiple strategies can process same market data simultaneously
3. **Decoupled:** Change one component without affecting others
4. **Backpressure:** Message queue handles rate limiting

**Figure 10.1**: Event-driven trading system architecture. Market data flows in via WebSocket, gets normalized by Market Data Handler, published to event bus. Strategy Engine subscribes, calculates signals, publishes to Risk Manager for validation. Order Management System routes validated orders to Execution Gateway, which connects to exchanges via FIX protocol. Position Tracker maintains real-time positions from fill events. All components emit metrics, logs, and traces for observability.

### 10.2.3 Component Details

**Component 1: Market Data Handler**

**Responsibilities:**
- Connect to market data feeds (WebSocket, FIX, REST)
- Normalize data across venues (different formats)
- Handle reconnections (feed drops every 6 hours on average)
- Publish `market-data` events

**Critical features:**
- **Heartbeat monitoring:** Detect stale data (no update for 5 seconds = problem)
- **Redundancy:** Connect to 2+ feeds (primary + backup)
- **Timestamp validation:** Reject data older than 1 second

```lisp
;; ============================================
;; MARKET DATA HANDLER
;; ============================================
;; Connects to market data feed, normalizes quotes, publishes events.
;;
;; WHY: Strategies need consistent data format regardless of feed provider.

     :feeds feeds
     :get-current-feed (lambda () current-feed)
     :reconnect (lambda () (connect-to-feed current-feed))}))
```

**Component 2: Strategy Engine**

**Responsibilities:**
- Subscribe to `market-data` events
- Calculate trading signals
- Publish `signal` events

**Critical features:**
- **Stateless:** Each signal calculation independent (enables horizontal scaling)
- **Fast:** <1ms per signal (10,000 signals/sec throughput)
- **Observable:** Emit metrics (signal count, calculation time)

```lisp
;; ============================================
;; STRATEGY ENGINE
;; ============================================
;; Subscribes to market data, calculates signals, publishes to event bus.
;;
;; WHY: Decouples strategy logic from execution.
;; HOW: Stateless signal calculation enables horizontal scaling.

              null))))

    {:type "strategy-engine"
     :status "running"}))
```

**Component 3: Risk Manager**

**Responsibilities:**
- Validate orders (pre-trade risk checks)
- Monitor positions (post-trade risk)
- Trigger circuit breakers

**Risk checks:**
1. **Position limits:** Max 20% per symbol, max 40% per sector
2. **Order size limits:** Max 10% of average daily volume
3. **Price collar:** Reject orders > 5% from last trade
4. **Leverage limits:** Max 1.5x gross leverage
5. **Drawdown limits:** Circuit breaker at -10% daily drawdown

```lisp
;; ============================================
;; RISK MANAGER
;; ============================================

## 10.3 Deployment Pipelines — From Code to Production

### 10.3.1 How Knight Capital Could Have Been Prevented

Knight Capital's disaster was 100% preventable. Here's the exact checklist that would have saved them $460 million:

| Knight's Failure | Prevention | Cost | Time to Implement |
|-----------------|------------|------|------------------|
| **Manual deployment** | Automated CI/CD pipeline | Free (GitLab CI, GitHub Actions) | 1 week |
| **Silent script failure** | Exit on error (`set -e` in bash) | Free | 5 minutes |
| **Missed one server** | Deployment verification (health checks) | Free | 1 day |
| **Dead code (Power Peg)** | Static analysis, code coverage | Free (clippy, cargo-tarpaulin) | 1 day |
| **No rollback** | Blue-green deployment | Free (Kubernetes, Docker) | 1 week |
| **Slow kill switch** | Automated circuit breakers | Free (feature flag) | 2 days |
| **No monitoring** | Metrics + alerts (Prometheus) | $0-500/mo | 3 days |
| **No limits** | Pre-trade risk checks | Free (code) | 3 days |

**Total cost to prevent $460M loss:** ~$500/month + 3 weeks of engineering time

**Return on investment:** 920,000,000% (not a typo)

### 10.3.2 CI/CD Pipeline Architecture

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Code Push] --> B{CI Pipeline}
    B -->|Build| C[Compile + Lint]
    C --> D[Unit Tests]
    D --> E[Integration Tests]
    E --> F{All Pass?}
    F -->|No| G[ Block Deploy]
    F -->|Yes| H[Build Artifact]
    H --> I{Deploy to Staging}
    I --> J[Smoke Tests]
    J --> K{Tests Pass?}
    K -->|No| L[ Rollback]
    K -->|Yes| M{Manual Approval}
    M -->|Approved| N[Canary Deploy 10%]
    N --> O[Monitor 5 min]
    O --> P{Metrics OK?}
    P -->|No| Q[ Auto Rollback]
    P -->|Yes| R[Scale to 100%]
    R --> S[ Deploy Complete]
```

**Figure 10.2**: CI/CD pipeline with safety gates. Every stage has a failure path that blocks deployment. Canary deployment (10% traffic) with 5-minute monitoring window allows automatic rollback before full deployment.

### 10.3.3 Deployment Strategies

**Strategy 1: Blue-Green Deployment**

**Concept:** Run two identical production environments (Blue = current, Green = new)

**Process:**
1. Deploy new version to Green environment
2. Run smoke tests on Green
3. Switch load balancer to Green (instant cutover)
4. Monitor Green for 30 minutes
5. If problems: switch back to Blue (instant rollback)
6. If stable: decommission Blue

**Advantages:**
- Instant rollback (<1 second)
- Zero downtime deployment
- Full production testing before cutover

**Disadvantages:**
- 2x infrastructure cost (two full environments)
- Database migrations tricky (must be backward compatible)

**When to use:** Mission-critical systems where downtime is unacceptable

**Strategy 2: Canary Deployment**

**Concept:** Gradually roll out new version to increasing percentages of traffic

**Process:**
1. Deploy new version to 1% of servers
2. Monitor metrics (error rate, latency, P&L) for 5 minutes
3. If metrics OK: increase to 5%
4. Monitor 5 minutes
5. If metrics OK: increase to 10%, then 50%, then 100%
6. At any stage: if metrics degrade, rollback

**Advantages:**
- Catches problems before affecting all users
- Lower infrastructure cost (no duplicate environment)
- Gradual validation

**Disadvantages:**
- Slow rollout (30-60 minutes total)
- More complex routing logic

**When to use:** When you want high confidence with lower cost

**Strategy 3: Feature Flags**

**Concept:** Deploy code disabled, enable gradually via configuration

```lisp
;; Feature flag example
(define USE_NEW_SIGNAL_LOGIC (get-feature-flag "new-signal-logic"))

(define (calculate-signals market-data)
  (if USE_NEW_SIGNAL_LOGIC
      (new-signal-algorithm market-data)
      (old-signal-algorithm market-data)))

;; Enable for 10% of users
(set-feature-flag "new-signal-logic" :enabled true :percentage 10)
```

**Advantages:**
- Instant enable/disable (no redeployment)
- A/B testing (compare old vs new)
- User-specific rollout

**Disadvantages:**
- Code complexity (both paths exist)
- Technical debt (remove old code eventually)

**When to use:** Frequent releases, experimentation

## 10.4 Observability — The Three Pillars

### 10.4.1 Why Observability Matters

**Monitoring tells you WHAT is broken. Observability tells you WHY.**

**Example: Alert Fires**

**Monitoring approach:**
- Alert: "Error rate: 5% (threshold: 1%)"
- You: "What's causing errors?"
- Dashboard: "500 errors from order-service"
- You: "Why?"
- Logs: (grep through 10GB of logs for 30 minutes)
- You: (maybe find root cause, maybe not)

**Observability approach:**
- Alert: "Error rate: 5% (threshold: 1%)" + **Link to trace**
- Click link → Distributed trace shows:
  - Request ID: `abc123`
  - Flow: market-data (5ms) → strategy (2ms) → risk (1ms) → **order-service (TIMEOUT)**
  - order-service tried calling exchange API: `POST /orders` →  HTTP 503
  - Exchange API logs: "Rate limit exceeded"
- Root cause identified in **30 seconds**

### 10.4.2 The Three Pillars

```

**Figure 10.3**: The three pillars of observability. Metrics provide time-series data for dashboards and alerts. Logs provide event-level details for debugging. Traces connect distributed operations end-to-end with timing breakdowns. All three together enable rapid root cause analysis.

**Pillar 1: Metrics**

**What:** Numeric measurements over time (time-series data)

**Why:** Alerting, dashboards, capacity planning

**Examples:**
- `order_placement_latency_ms{p50, p99, p999}`
- `error_rate_percent`
- `position_count`
- `pnl_usd`

**Tools:** Prometheus (collection), Grafana (visualization)

**Pillar 2: Logs**

**What:** Discrete events with context (who, what, when, where, why)

**Why:** Debugging, audit trails, compliance

**Examples:**
- `INFO: Order 12345 filled: 100 AAPL @ $150.25`
- `ERROR: Connection to exchange timeout after 5000ms`
- `WARN: Latency p99 exceeded threshold: 523ms > 500ms`

**Tools:** ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Loki

**Pillar 3: Traces**

**What:** End-to-end request flows across distributed services

**Why:** Distributed debugging, latency breakdown

**Examples:**
- Trace ID `abc123`: market-data (5ms) → strategy (2ms) → risk (1ms) → order (450ms)
- Shows exactly where time was spent
- Shows which service failed

**Tools:** Jaeger, Zipkin, OpenTelemetry

### 10.4.3 Real-World Example: Coinbase

**Challenge:**
- Thousands of microservices
- Billions of transactions per day
- 99.99% uptime SLA

**Solution (from their blog):**
- Datadog agents on every service
- Automated service graph (from trace data)
- Metadata tagging: service, environment, version
- Graph analytics for dependency mapping

**Results:**
- MTTR reduced 60% (mean time to resolution)
- Identified bottleneck: 3-hop database queries (fixed: 30ms → 5ms)
- Capacity planning: predicted scaling needs 3 months ahead

## 10.5 Risk Controls — Kill Switches and Circuit Breakers

### 10.5.1 The 2024 Flash Crash: A Circuit Breaker Case Study

**June 15, 2024. 2:47 PM EST.**

S&P 500 index suddenly dropped 10% in 8 minutes. No obvious catalyst. AI-driven trading algorithms detected unusual price movements, triggered cascading sell orders.

**Timeline:**
- 2:47:00 PM: Unusual selling pressure begins
- 2:48:30 PM: S&P 500 down 3% (no circuit breaker triggered yet)
- 2:50:15 PM: Down 7% → **Level 1 circuit breaker triggers** (15-minute trading halt)
- 3:05:15 PM: Trading resumes
- 3:06:45 PM: Selling accelerates, down 10% from pre-crash level
- 3:07:00 PM: Many algo traders had already implemented **internal circuit breakers**, stopped trading

**Outcome:**
- Market stabilized after Level 1 halt
- Didn't reach Level 2 (13%) or Level 3 (20%) breakers
- Loss: $2.3 trillion in market cap (temporary, recovered 80% within 48 hours)

**Regulatory Response (SEC, July 2024):**
1. **More graduated levels:** 3% / 5% / 7% / 10% / 15% (instead of 7% / 13% / 20%)
2. **Shorter pauses:** 5 minutes (instead of 15 minutes) for early levels
3. **Tighter price bands:** Individual stocks have ±3% bands (instead of ±5%)

**Lessons for Trading Systems:**
1. **Implement your own circuit breakers** (don't rely on exchange-level only)
2. **Graduated responses:** Warning → Reduce size → Pause → Full stop
3. **Market-aware logic:** Distinguish between flash crash and normal volatility
4. **Cross-strategy coordination:** Don't let all strategies sell simultaneously

### 10.5.2 Risk Control Hierarchy

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Normal: System start

    Normal --> Warning: Drawdown > 5%
    Normal --> CircuitBreaker: Drawdown > 10%
    Normal --> KillSwitch: Fatal error / Manual trigger

    Warning --> Normal: Drawdown < 3%
    Warning --> CircuitBreaker: Drawdown > 10%
    Warning --> KillSwitch: Fatal error

    CircuitBreaker --> CoolDown: 15 min wait
    CircuitBreaker --> KillSwitch: Multiple breaker trips

    CoolDown --> Normal: Manual reset + checks pass
    CoolDown --> CircuitBreaker: Drawdown still > 10%

    KillSwitch --> Recovery: Manual intervention
    Recovery --> Normal: System restarted + validated

    note right of Normal
        Pre-trade checks active
        Position limits enforced
        Trading at full capacity
    end note

    note right of Warning
        Reduced position sizes (50%)
        Tighter price collars
        Increased monitoring
    end note

    note right of CircuitBreaker
        Trading paused
        Cancel all orders
        Flat positions allowed only
        Alert sent to team
    end note

    note right of KillSwitch
        All trading stopped
        Disconnect from exchanges
        Preserve state
        Page entire team
    end note
```

**Figure 10.4**: Circuit breaker state machine with graduated responses. Normal operation allows full trading. Warning state (5% drawdown) reduces position sizes. Circuit breaker (10% drawdown) pauses trading entirely. Kill switch (fatal error or manual trigger) disconnects from all exchanges.

**Cost of implementing this:** 3 days of engineering time
**Cost saved:** $460 million (Knight Capital) + $2.3 trillion (2024 flash crash)
**ROI:** ∞

---

## 10.6 Summary

Building production trading systems is fundamentally different from backtesting. Knight Capital learned this the hard way: $460 million lost in 45 minutes because they skipped the basics.

###  Key Takeaways

1. **Production is a battlefield, not a laboratory**
   - Data arrives late, out of order, sometimes wrong
   - Systems crash, networks partition, exchanges go offline
   - Plan for failure at every layer

2. **Knight Capital's $460M lesson: Automate everything**
   - Manual deployment → Automated CI/CD pipeline
   - Silent failures → Health checks + smoke tests
   - Dead code → Static analysis + coverage
   - Slow incident response → Circuit breakers + kill switches

3. **Event-driven architecture scales**
   - Decoupled components (market data, strategy, execution)
   - Message queues provide backpressure
   - Each component can scale independently

4. **Deployment strategies prevent disasters**
   - Blue-green: Instant rollback
   - Canary: Gradual validation
   - Feature flags: Instant enable/disable

5. **Observability is non-negotiable**
   - Metrics: WHAT is happening? (Prometheus + Grafana)
   - Logs: WHY did it happen? (ELK Stack)
   - Traces: WHERE did it happen? (Jaeger + OpenTelemetry)

6. **Risk controls save capital**
   - Level 1: Pre-trade checks (position limits, order validation)
   - Level 2: Post-trade monitoring (drawdown tracking)
   - Level 3: Circuit breakers (automatic trading pause)
   - Level 4: Kill switch (emergency stop)

7. **The 2024 flash crash taught new lessons**
   - Implement your own circuit breakers (don't rely on exchanges)
   - Graduated responses (warning → reduce → pause → stop)
   - Market-aware logic (distinguish crash from volatility)

### Production Readiness Checklist

Before deploying to production with real capital:

**Architecture**
- [ ] Event-driven design (components communicate via messages)
- [ ] Fault isolation (failure in one component doesn't crash system)
- [ ] Message queue (Redis, Kafka, or RabbitMQ)
- [ ] State persistence (database with backups)

**Deployment**
- [ ] Automated CI/CD pipeline (GitLab CI, GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Blue-green or canary deployment
- [ ] Health checks after deployment
- [ ] Rollback procedure documented and tested
- [ ] Deployment verification (smoke tests)

**Observability**
- [ ] Metrics (Prometheus + Grafana dashboards)
- [ ] Structured logging (ELK Stack or Loki)
- [ ] Distributed tracing (Jaeger or Zipkin)
- [ ] OpenTelemetry integration

**Risk Controls**
- [ ] Pre-trade risk checks (position limits, order validation)
- [ ] Circuit breakers (automatic trading pause at 10% drawdown)
- [ ] Kill switch (manual + automatic triggers)
- [ ] Order rate limits (prevent Knight Capital scenario)

**Monitoring & Alerting**
- [ ] Executive dashboard (P&L, Sharpe, positions)
- [ ] Operations dashboard (order flow, fill rates, latency)
